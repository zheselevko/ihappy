  "readme": "# grunt-dploy\n\n> [DPLOY](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy) is an FTP/SFTP deployment tool built in node.js\n\n*Issues with DPLOY should be reported on the [DPLOY repo](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy).*\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you haven't used [grunt][] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][] guide, as it explains how to create a [gruntfile][Getting Started] as well as install and use grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, install this plugin with this command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev grunt-dploy\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-dploy');\n```\n\n\n[grunt]: http://gruntjs.com\n[Getting Started]: http://gruntjs.com/getting-started\n\n\n### Example\n\n```js\ngrunt.initConfig({\n    dploy: {                                    // Task\n        stage: {                                // Target\n            host: \"ftp.myserver.com\"            // Your FTP host\n            user: \"user\"                        // Your FTP user\n            pass: \"secret-password\"             // Your FTP secret-password\n            path: {\n                local: \"deploy/\",               // The local folder that you want to upload\n                remote: \"public_html/\"          // Where the files from the local file will be uploaded at in your remote server\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-dploy');\ngrunt.registerTask('default', ['dploy']);\n```\n\nFor more examples and the full documentation, visit the [DPLOY](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy) repository.\n\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Lean Mean Fighting Machine, Inc. http://lmfm.co.uk\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
